# 🚗 Calculate Speed of Car Project

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to **detect and calculate the speed of vehicles** in real-time using **computer vision techniques**. By analyzing video footage from traffic cameras or dashcams, this system can estimate the speed of moving cars and help with applications such as:

- Traffic violation detection
- Speed monitoring
- Smart city surveillance
- Autonomous driving systems

The system uses **OpenCV**, **object detection/tracking**, and basic **physics formulas** to compute vehicle speed based on pixel-to-meter conversion and frame rate.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Detect vehicles in video frames using object detection models or background subtraction.
2. Track vehicles across consecutive frames.
3. Estimate distance traveled using calibrated pixel-to-meter ratios.
4. Calculate speed using time difference between frames.
5. Display speed on screen and log results if needed.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **YOLOv8 / MobileNet SSD** (for vehicle detection)
- **DeepSORT / SORT** (for vehicle tracking)
- **Matplotlib** (optional for visualization)

## 🔬 Methodology

### Step 1: Video Input & Frame Extraction

- Read input video using OpenCV:
  ```python
  cap = cv2.VideoCapture("data/videos/traffic.mp4")
  ```

### Step 2: Vehicle Detection

- Use a pre-trained object detection model like **YOLOv8** or **MobileNet SSD** to detect vehicles.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('models/yolov8s.pt')
results = model(frame)
```

### Step 3: Vehicle Tracking

- Use **DeepSORT or SORT** to track vehicles across frames and assign unique IDs.

```python
tracker.update(detections)
for track in tracker.tracks:
    bbox = track.bbox
    track_id = track.track_id
```

### Step 4: Distance and Speed Calculation

Use the formula:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
$$

Where:
- **Distance** is calculated by measuring the change in position (in pixels) × pixel-to-meter ratio.
- **Time** is determined by frame rate (e.g., 30 FPS → 1/30 seconds per frame).

Example code:
```python
distance_pixels = abs(current_center - previous_center)
pixel_to_meter_ratio = 0.05  # Calibrate manually
distance_meters = distance_pixels * pixel_to_meter_ratio
time_seconds = 1 / fps
speed_mps = distance_meters / time_seconds
speed_kph = speed_mps * 3.6
```

### Step 5: Display Results

Overlay speed value on detected vehicles:

```python
cv2.putText(frame, f"{int(speed_kph)} km/h", (x, y), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
```

## 📈 Sample Output

| Frame | Output Description |
|-------|--------------------|
| ![Input](images/input.jpg) | Raw video frame |
| ![Output](images/output.jpg) | Detected car with speed overlay |

## 🚀 Future Work

1. **Calibration Automation**: Automatically calculate pixel-to-meter ratio using known reference objects.
2. **Alert System**: Trigger alerts when speed exceeds limit.
3. **License Plate Recognition (LPR)**: Combine with OCR to identify speeding vehicles.
4. **Web Interface**: Build a Flask/Django app for live camera feeds.
5. **Edge Deployment**: Run on Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano for real-world use.
